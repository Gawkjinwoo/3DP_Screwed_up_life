Self stabilized arduino quadcopter program: 
  This arduino program was invented with school club members for studying self-stabilized algorithm of quadcopter.
  Above all, Almost of critical ideas were studied from 'YMFC-AL' project from Joop Brokking.net
  
  2019/10/14 : First flight with "SUL_Drone_control_V4"
               Performance of quadcopter(Stabilization) was more excellent than we expected.
               However, it was hard to control the height of quad and landing.
               Next goal will be height control and more stable landing.
